# Flatfile Configuration Starter

## Setup your environment variables

Before you begin, set up your environment variables. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and update it with your credentials.

Your `.env` file should look similar to this:

```
FLATFILE_ENVIRONMENT_ID=us_env_1234
FLATFILE_API_KEY=sk_1234
WEBHOOK_SITE_URL=https://webhook.site/1234
```
